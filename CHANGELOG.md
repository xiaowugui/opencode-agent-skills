## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Fixed crash on macOS ARM64 (Apple Silicon) caused by `onnxruntime-node@1.21.0` segfault regression by pinning to 1.20.1 ([#31](https://github.com/joshuadavidthomas/opencode-agent-skills/issues/31), [microsoft/onnxruntime#24096](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/24096))

## [0.6.4]

### Fixed

- Fixed YAML frontmatter parsing for skills with multi-line descriptions (block scalar `|` and `>` syntax) by replacing custom parser with the `yaml` library
- Added support for Claude's plugin v2 format in `installed_plugins.json`, which uses an array of installations per plugin instead of a single object

### Changed

- Claude Code plugin cache discovery now handles the new nested directory structure (`cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>/skills/`)

## [0.6.3]

### Changed

- Improved skill evaluation prompt to hopefully prevent models from announcing "no skill required" style messages to users (who cannot see the hidden evaluation prompt)

## [0.6.2]

### Fixed

- Skill validation now allows directory names to differ from the `name` in SKILL.md frontmatter. The frontmatter `name` is the canonical identifier, while directory names are for organization only. This aligns with the Anthropic Agent Skills spec.

## [0.6.1]

### Changed

- Dynamic skill suggestions now track loaded skills per session and avoid re-suggesting already-loaded skills, reducing redundant prompts and context usage

## [0.6.0]

### Added

- Semantic skill matching: after the initial skills list injection, subsequent messages are matched against skill descriptions using local embeddings
- Added `@huggingface/transformers` dependency for local embedding generation (quantized all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- When a message matches available skills, injects a 3-step evaluation prompt (EVALUATE → DECIDE → ACTIVATE) to encourage skill loading (inspired by [@spences10](https://github.com/spences10)'s [blog post](https://scottspence.com/posts/how-to-make-claude-code-skills-activate-reliably))
- Disk-cached embeddings for low-latency matching (~/.cache/opencode-agent-skills/)
- Session cleanup on `session.deleted` event

## [0.5.0]

### Added

- Added "Did you mean..." fuzzy matching suggestions when skill or script names are not found in all tools (`use_skill`, `read_skill_file`, `run_skill_script`, `get_available_skills`)

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Renamed `find_skills` tool to `get_available_skills` for clearer intent
- **Internal**: Reorganized codebase into separate modules (`claude.ts`, `skills.ts`, `tools.ts`, `utils.ts`, `superpowers.ts`) for better maintainability
- **Internal**: Improved code quality by removing AI-generated comments and unnecessary code

## [0.4.1]

### Changed

- Installation method now uses npm package via OpenCode config instead of git clone + symlink

### Removed

- Removed `INSTALL.md` (no longer needed with simplified installation)

## [0.4.0]

### Changed

- Script discovery now recursively searches the entire skill directory (max depth 10) instead of only the root and `scripts/` subdirectory
- Scripts are now identified by relative path (e.g., `tools/build.sh`) instead of base name
- Renamed `skill_name` parameter to `skill` in `read_skill_file`, `run_skill_script`, and `use_skill` tools
- Renamed `script_name` parameter to `script` in `run_skill_script` tool

## [0.3.3]

### Fixed

- Fixed file and directory detection to properly handle symlinks by using `fs.stat`

## [0.3.2]

### Fixed

- Preserve agent mode when injecting synthetic messages on session start

## [0.3.1]

### Fixed

- Fixed unintended model switching when using skill tools by explicitly passing the current model during `noReply` operations (workaround for opencode issue #4475)

## [0.3.0]

### Added

- Added file listing to `use_skill` output

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- Added support for superpowers mode
- Added release attestations

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Added `use_skill` tool to load skill content into context
- Added `read_skill_file` tool to read supporting files from skill directories
- Added `run_skill_script` tool to execute scripts from skill directories
- Added `find_skills` tool to search and list available skills
- Added multi-location skill discovery (project, user, and Claude-compatible locations)
- Added Anthropic Agent Skills Spec v1.0 compliant frontmatter validation
- Added automatic skills list injection on session start and after context compaction
